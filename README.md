# Binary Trees (Holberton School) 

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It contains tasks and exercises related to binary trees, a type of tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.

## Learning Objectives

- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Installation and Usage of Program
**Prerequisites**
* C Compiler (e.g., GCC)

**To use the shell, follow these steps:**

* Clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/arbesavdiaj/holbertonschool-binary_trees.git
```
* Navigate to the project directory: 
```
cd holbertonschool-binary_trees
```
* Compile file: 
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic binary_tree_print.c [file] 0-main.c -o 0-node

```
Replace `[file]` with the name of the file containing the function you want to test, and `0-main.c` with the name of the file containing the main function. You can also change the output name (0-node) as you wish.
* Run the shell with the name of output: 
```
./[name-of-output]
```
